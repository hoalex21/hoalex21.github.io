                    I&apos;m Alex and I&apos;m currently studying for my B.S. in Computer Science at Drexel University and will be graduating in June 2024.
                    I have a passion for technology and expressing myself creatively through software.
                    Whether it be a great web browsing experience or a quirky game, I hope there is something that I can provide you through my work. &hearts;
